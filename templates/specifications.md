## Phase 2.1: Technical Specification Brainstorming (Socratic Design Dialog)

### LLM Input Template

```
I need to develop technical specifications for my data science tool. I have completed the foundational analysis:

INTENT DOCUMENT:
[Copy complete Intent Document from Phase 1.1]

NEGATIVE SPACE MAP:
[Copy complete Negative Space Map from Phase 1.2 - all identified failure modes and constraints]

REUSE OPPORTUNITIES:
[Copy reuse assessment from Phase 1.1]

Act as my Socratic teacher to help me work backwards from my goals to implementation. I need to systematically explore design decisions, data structures, algorithms, user interfaces, and technical approaches.

Focus on helping me discover:
- What data structures and file formats will support my goals while avoiding the failure modes we identified?
- What algorithmic approaches will handle the edge cases and scale requirements?
- How should components interact to prevent the integration disasters we mapped?
- What user interface and error handling will make the tool robust and usable?

Ask ONE question at a time, building on my responses. Help me think through the implications of each design choice before moving to the next decision.

Start with the highest-level architectural decisions and progressively get more specific.
```

### Design Exploration Notes

#### Data Structures and File Formats
**Design Decision:** [What data structures will you use?]

#### User Interface Design
**Design Decision:** [Command line? Jupyter notebook? Scripts? Functions?]  
**Rationale:** [How does this serve your users and use cases?]  
**Trade-offs:** [Ease of use vs. flexibility vs. automation potential]

#### Error Handling Strategy
**Design Decision:** [How will you handle failures and edge cases?]  
**Rationale:** [How does this address failure modes from Phase 1.2?]
